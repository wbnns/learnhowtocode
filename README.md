### Acknowledgments and special thanks

Many special thanks, credit and acknowledgment goes to [Erik Trautman](https://github.com/eriktrautman) who originally spearheaded the [assembly of the material](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum), an open curriculum for learning web development, that this GitBook is based on. He used it to found [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). People all over the world have used it to learn how to code!

Much recognition is also due to all of the collaborators, contributors and volunteers who have over the years expanded and improved this curriculum.

Without these people, this site would not exist. üôè
