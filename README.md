# Welcome

## Overview

This website is divided into several sections to help you learn how to code, and for those who already do, to become a better developer. Stick to this material, and you grant yourself a hammer, a saw, and a lifetime supply of wood and nails.

> Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that all was vanity; but the dreamers of the day are dangerous, for they may act their dream with open eyes, and make it possible.

What would you build, if self-doubt was the only thing that could stop you?

### Acknowledgments and many special thanks

Many special thanks, credit and acknowledgment goes to [Erik Trautman](https://github.com/eriktrautman) who originally spearheaded the [assembly of the material](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum), an open curriculum for learning web development, that this GitBook is based on. He used it to found [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). People all over the world have used it to learn how to code!

Much recognition is also due to all of the collaborators, contributors and volunteers who have over the years expanded and improved this curriculum.

Without these people, this site would not exist. üôè
