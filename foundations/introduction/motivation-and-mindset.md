# Motivation and mindset

## Time to build

Learning to code is incredibly rewarding but can also be difficult and frustrating. The strongest assets you can have as a student are a desire to build, a problem-solving mind, and persistence in the face of setbacks.

The web development industry has a long history of successful developers with varying backgrounds, so people tend to care more about what you've actually **built** than how you got there.

Read [this comprehensive blog post from Happy Bear Software](http://web.archive.org/web/20160925155912/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/how-to-get-a-programmer-job.html) about the journey to getting hired as a brief introduction to what you will face ahead.

## Why read this?

There are plenty of other online curricula for beginners, but they are often taught in an extremely isolated and controlled environment and cover only a specific topic.

This curriculum takes a realistic view of what you need to know and has you set up and work in your own environment, much like what you'll be doing when you get a job.

It acknowledges that you need a wide variety of skillsets and languages to reach an employable level.

This curriculum is constantly evolving because of people like you who get further along in the curriculum and pay it forward by incrementally improving our content over time.

Once you start to feel comfortable with the tools, start hacking on open source projects. The more you contribute, the more you will learn about what you can do, and the closer you will get to being hireable. These projects will also look great on your resume!
