# Final words

## Sharing your experience

We hope you're reading this from your new office. If you got a job after doing this curriculum, [let us know!](https://discord.com/invite/fbFCkYabZB) If you haven't, **don't give up.** 

We'd love to hear how everything is going, and we have a Discord channel where anyone can share their stories. The whole reason for putting this project out there is to try and onboard more people into the web development profession and tech in general. Hopefully you will inspire even more people to give it a shot.

So build some awesome software, learn as much as you can, and pay it forward when you're able to.
