# Computer Science

Computer Science is a huge, broad subject; with many bits not directly having to do with code. This course is aimed to give you a taste of some of the theory that goes behind the frameworks and built-in methods you use; the algorithms behind them, and some of the data structures you may have to employ in your quest to write decent code. Although there will be practical elements, a considerable amount of theory is covered here.
